# Symage

Wahoo, you found one of my most silliest projects ever.

Ever been curious what a image sounds like or what sound looks like?

Ever wanted to design sound or create some abstract art in weird ways?

Ever wanted to apply sound reverb to an image and image filters to sounds, or see how JPEG compression distorts audio?

HAAAAH!
You can't yet, it's not finished just yet.

SOON!
